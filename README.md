Old English Translator Challenge
by Samantha Scharr

Instructions: Here you are presented with a short sentence in Old English
		Below each word is a drop menu with a selection of 4 possible Mondern English words. 
		From that menu select your best guess at what the Old English word
		translates to. When you are done click the submit button and you will be 
		told if your translation is correct or not. 

		Note: The translation will not be in idiomatic Modern English due to
		changes in grammar over time.
